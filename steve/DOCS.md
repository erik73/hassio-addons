Depending on other add-ons that are installed 4GB might not be enough.

It is also important to understand that the admin_user and admin_password can not be
changed after the first start of the add-on, since the MariaDB database is created with
these credentials the first time the add-on is started.

There is no ingress support, so to reach the SteVe web interface you have to point your
