## About

Important: This addon requires that the MariaDB add-on is installed and running!

This add-on is experimental, and provides a webmail frontend that connects
to the Mailserver add-on. It also enables you to configure Sieve scripts
for your mailbox.

The following ports are used by this addon:

http or https: 2665

Is is possible to change this in the Network section of the configuration.

If you are brave, you may want to expose Roundcube to the Internet by forwarding
port 2665 in your router. DonÂ´t even consider this unless you have enabled SSL!

You reach the Roundcube interface by clicking the Web UI button in the add-on
page. You can also point your browser to: http://{homeassistant IP}:2665 or
if you enable the SSL option it is http://{homeassistant IP}:2665. It is also
possible to use the hostname insted of IP address.
