# Home Assistant Add-on: phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is a database administration tool for MySQL & MariaDB. Frequently
used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes,
users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface,
while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

This add-on was specifically designed to manage the official Home Assistant
MariaDB add-on.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

Add the repository `https://github.com/erik73/hassio-addons`.
Find the "phpMyAdmin" add-on and click it.
Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `upload_limit`

By default, the size limit for uploads (for operations such as imports) is set to
64MB. This can be increased with this option, for example, `100` would be 100MB.

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on needs the core MariaDB add-on version 2.0 or higher.
- This add-on is created to allow management of the official Home assistant
  MariaDB add-on. It cannot connect to other MySQL or MariaDB servers.
